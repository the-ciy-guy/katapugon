                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>Well... if you haven't already figured it out it's a kind of an autobiographic comic strip about trying to adjust to life in a new country.</p>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>I'm the creator of this strip, I'm a Korean adoptee from Sweden.</p>

            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Are you the main character in this comic?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>The main character is loosely based on me and some other people I know, it's kind of a mix of several people.</p>

            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Why is it so poorly drawn, do you even know how to draw?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>To be honest, I have no idea how to draw, you can see with your own eyes right? Then you can see I obviously can't draw.</p>

            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">So then why even try to make a comic strip?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>I like the medium and I think it's a much more interesting way to tell my story in this format than trying to write a book or something.</p>

            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Ok but why do you want to tackle this topic when it has already been done much better by other people?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>Because everyone else are treating this topic super serious, it feels like it's a competition on who has had it the hardest. I want to show a different side off it and make people both laugh and think</p>
                </div>
            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">But isn't this a very serious topic?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>It is a serious topic but that doesn't mean you can't treat it in a more comedic way. There's a lot of great comedy in the seriousness.</p>

            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">I'm not totally sold on the idea but ok, let's move on. How do you come up with ideas for the strip?</p></button>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>Either from own experiences or from stories I have heard from other people.</p>

                <div class="text-block">

            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>Thanks!! I built and designed it myself, the idea behind the design was to make it look like a comic book page.</p>

            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Do you intend to improve your drawing skills?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>First of all it's not about how good your drawings look like it's mainly in the writing. But to your point, I assume I'll improve the more I draw this comic.</p>

            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">When did you start drawing?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>I think I started doodling a couple of years ago and then I bought some books, watched some youtube videos and so on.</p>
                </div>
            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Who has been your biggest influence?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>I've been influenced by many different creators all over the world, some swedish creators some international. It's important to get inspiration from many different sources.</p>
                </div>
            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Can you tell us a little bit about the tools you are using?</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>Sure, I just use a mechanical pencil I bought for like $1 and some Staedler pigment liners. I also use a couple of Pigma Micron pens. Oh and an eraser, a lot of erasing going on.</p>

            </div>    
            <button class="accordion faq"><p class="bold">Describe the whole process for us.</p></button>
            <div class="panel-accordion">
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>First I write down some notes on what I want the strip to be about. After that I do some rough sketches. When I'm happy with the sketches and the writing I move on to actual draw the strip. After drawing I scan the page into the computer and touch up the lines a bit and then I print the page and ink it.</p>
